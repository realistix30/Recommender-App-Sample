## What is this for?

This app is a real world example of how to integrate UbiOps and make requests to your model into your own WebApp.

You can find an article that describes this use case [here](https://medium.com/dutch-analytics-tech/how-to-build-and-implement-a-recommendation-system-from-scratch-in-python-b5a04d9e8331).

:warning: Before trying to call the UbiOps API from your own domain, send us a message and we'll whitelist it for you! You'll soon be able to do it yourself from the UbiOps WebApp though.

## How do I call my model from a WebApp?

This app is using ReactJs. Although, the request sent to the model hosted on UbiOps is plain JavaScript and the code can be use in any JavaScript framework/library.

The only component we're interested in here is [Recommendation.js](src/components/Recommendations/Recommendations.js).

You can simply follow these 3 steps to do the same in your WebApp:

1. Define all the parameters you'll need to call your model:

```js
const API_TOKEN = "<your-api-token>";
const API_URL = "https://api.ubiops.com/v2.1";
const PROJECT_NAME = "<your-project-name>";
const DEPLOYMENT_NAME = "<your-deployment-name>";
const DEPLOYMENT_VERSION = "<your-version-name>";
```

2. Then define an asynchronous function to request data from the UbiOps API:

```js
async function postRequest(url = "", data = {}) {
  const response = await fetch(API_URL + url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: API_TOKEN,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

3. Finally, make a request to your model:

```js
postRequest(
  `/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/deployments/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/versions/${DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}/request`,
  // `clicked_product` is part of the input fields defined in the model
  { clicked_product: product }
).then((response) => {
  // your data is in `response.result` and `result` contains all the output fields defined in your model
};
```

## How do I run this app?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can run the usual scripts using `npm` (see the `scripts` section in [package.json](package.json)).
